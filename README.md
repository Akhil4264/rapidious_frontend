# React Application

This project is a React application that requires both a frontend and a backend to run properly.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the latest version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your system. This will provide you with both Node.js and npm (node package manager).

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to get your development environment set up:

1. **Clone the repository**

   First, clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ``` git clone https://github.com/Akhil4264/rapidious_frontend.git ```


2. **Navigate to the project directory**

    Change into the project directory:

    ``` cd rapidious_frontend ```


3. **Install dependencies**

    Install all the necessary dependencies using npm:

    ``` npm install ```


4. **Start the Backend Server (Important!)**

    Before starting the frontend server, make sure your backend server is running. Navigate to your backend directory and start the server:


    Ensure the backend server is running correctly and listening for connections.

5. **Start the Frontend Server**

    After the backend server is up and running, you can start the frontend server. Go back to your project's root directory and start the React application:

    ``` npm start ```

    This command will start the development server and open the React application in your default web browser.

## Usage

    After starting the server, you can access the application by navigating to `http://localhost` in your web browser.
